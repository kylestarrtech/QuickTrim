# QuickTrim

A super simple video-trimming software that I wanted to make because I hate going through a million steps just to trim a clip I got while playing games.

Supports:
* Drag and Drop
* .MP4 files (uses Ffmpeg so this is probably easily expanded if anyone cares to go for it)
* Trimming videos from set start and end points
* Saving the last X seconds of a video.
* Add shortcuts to the Windows Explorer right-click menu (uses Windows Registry shell shortcuts) **REQUIRES LAUNCHING AS ADMINISTRATOR**
